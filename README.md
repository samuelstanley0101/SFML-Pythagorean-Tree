# SFML-Pythagorean-Tree
Created February of 2024

A C++ Program which, given an depth of recursion and initial angle from the command line, creates a Pythagorean Tree using Simple Fast Media Library (SFML)

This program creates a binary tree of squares where each child square is connected to its parent square by its corners in such a way that the area inbetween the parent square and the two child squares forms a triangle. The depth of the tree and the angle between the parent square and its leftmost child are both paranmeters taken from the command line.

Syntax: ./PTree (Depth) (Angle)

Requires use of SFML, which can be downloaded here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.1/
